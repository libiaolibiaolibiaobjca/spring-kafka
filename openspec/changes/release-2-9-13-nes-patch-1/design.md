## Context

`spring-kafka-2.9` is a Git repository at `spring-kafka-2.9`. This change releases `2.9.13-nes.patch.1` from one dedicated source commit and records enough evidence for a fresh session to reconcile the component against Git, OpenSpec, and Nexus.

Representative publications:

`cn.bjca.footstone.bpring.kafka:bjca-footstone-bpring-kafka:2.9.13-nes.patch.1`

Declared internal dependencies:

none

Explicit exclusions:

`spring-kafka-docs Maven publication`

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Preserve unrelated work and establish single-session ownership before editing.
- Publish `2.9.13-nes.patch.1` with no internal `cn.bjca.footstone` SNAPSHOT metadata.
- Verify the catalog-defined local build, tests, publication metadata, and consumer behavior.
- Prove target absence before the single authorized Nexus deployment.
- Verify immutable remote assets before creating annotated tag `v2.9.13-nes.patch.1`.
- Keep component documentation and OpenSpec evidence sufficient for later reconciliation and archive.

**Non-Goals:**

- Do not introduce unrelated features, dependency upgrades, or refactors.
- Do not publish excluded modules or coordinates.
- Do not overwrite, delete, or redeploy an existing RELEASE version.
- Do not create the next development SNAPSHOT as part of this change.
- Do not store or print repository credentials.

## Decisions

### 1. Freeze the worktree before release edits

Record the current branch, origin, tracked changes, untracked paths, active OpenSpec changes, toolchain, current version, and target GAVs. Stop when unrelated tracked changes exist. Exclude local tool directories and other unapproved files from the release commit.

Only the manifest owner for `spring-kafka-2.9` may write to this repository while the component is being prepared.

### 2. Publish only a complete internal RELEASE dependency graph

Set the project version to `2.9.13-nes.patch.1` and update every internal dependency, parent, imported BOM, and plugin version to its approved RELEASE. Generate the complete local publication set and scan all generated POM/BOM metadata, not only the representative GAVs.

Any internal version ending in `-SNAPSHOT` is a hard failure.

### 3. Bind validation and publication to one release commit

Run:

- Build: `make build`
- Tests: `make test`
- Local publication/effective POM: `make install`

Run representative RELEASE-only consumer validation after local publication. Update `README.md`, `doc/QUICK_START.md`, `doc/USER_MANUAL.md`, `doc/GAV_MAPPING.md` before creating the dedicated release commit. Build and deploy from that recorded commit without subsequent source changes.

### 4. Separate reversible preparation from irreversible finalization

A child session may prepare this repository, run local gates, update component documentation, and create the local release commit while holding the owner lease.

The coordinating main session reviews evidence and controls:

- Nexus RELEASE deploy using `make deploy`;
- release commit push;
- annotated tag creation and push.

Every command remains a preview unless explicit execution and confirmation are provided.

### 5. Treat Nexus RELEASE as immutable

Immediately before deploy, check every GAV in the discovered publication set for absence. If any complete or partial asset exists, block deploy and investigate.

After the one authorized deploy, download representative POM and binary assets from Nexus RELEASE, verify version and metadata, calculate checksums, and run the RELEASE-only consumer smoke test. Do not create or push `v2.9.13-nes.patch.1` until the component reaches `nexus-verified`.

An uncertain or partial publication is reconciled first. Existing assets are never deleted or overwritten; a corrected release uses a new NES patch version.

### 6. Make the tag and archive auditable

Create annotated tag `v2.9.13-nes.patch.1` on the exact release commit used for deployment. Verify the remote branch and tag after push.

Keep the component OpenSpec active until Nexus, Git tag, component documentation, and central manifest evidence agree. Archive only after all completion gates pass.

## State Progression

```text
planned
  -> openspec-ready
  -> prepared
  -> locally-verified
  -> release-committed
  -> deployed
  -> nexus-verified
  -> tagged
  -> documented
  -> archived
```

`blocked` and `partial-failure` are terminal for automatic progression until the coordinator records an approved reconciliation. `superseded` identifies an immutable version replaced by a later NES patch.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Dirty worktree contaminates the release commit** — fail closed on unrelated tracked changes and review the staged diff.
- **Generated POM retains an internal SNAPSHOT** — scan every local and downloaded remote POM/BOM.
- **Multi-module deploy partially succeeds** — record existing assets, do not retry the version, and create a new patch plan.
- **Session ends after deploy** — reconcile Nexus and Git instead of repeating deploy.
- **Tag points to a different commit** — verify the tag target locally and remotely before archive.
- **Credentials leak into evidence** — use only user-level configuration and redact output before recording it.

## Recovery

- Before Nexus publication, fix release preparation through this change and repeat local verification.
- After uncertain deploy, freeze all release actions and inspect Nexus assets.
- After verified Nexus publication but failed Git push, retry only the push.
- After partial or incorrect publication, preserve evidence and replace this target with a newly approved patch version.
