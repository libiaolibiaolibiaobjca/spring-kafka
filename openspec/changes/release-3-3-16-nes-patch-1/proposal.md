## Why

`spring-kafka-3.3` currently targets `3.3.16-nes.patch.1` but does not yet have a complete, immutable, and independently auditable RELEASE lifecycle. The release must survive session loss, preserve unrelated work, and publish metadata that references only approved internal RELEASE dependencies.

## What Changes

- Freeze and inventory the `spring-kafka-3.3` worktree before release edits.
- Create RELEASE metadata for `3.3.16-nes.patch.1` and replace all internal SNAPSHOT references with approved RELEASE versions.
- Run the component-specific build, tests, local publication/effective-POM scan, and consumer verification.
- Form a dedicated release commit containing component release documentation and no unrelated changes.
- Verify every discovered target GAV is absent from Nexus RELEASE before the coordinator-authorized deploy.
- Download and verify published POM/binary assets and checksums from Nexus, then run RELEASE-only consumption.
- Create annotated tag `v3.3.16-nes.patch.1` on the exact release commit only after Nexus verification.
- Record Git, Nexus, documentation, and manifest evidence before archiving this change.
